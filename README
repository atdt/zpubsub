ZPubSub
=======

ZPubSub comprises `zpub` and `zsub`, a pair of utilities for piping data
between hosts using ØMQ's PubSub sockets.

ØMQ's PubSub pattern absolves the server from caring about whether any clients
are listening. Clients, on the other hand, are able to detect disconnects and
re-request data they missed. This makes ZPubSub ideal for aggregating logs from
servers without burdening them with additional responsibilities or points of
failure.

Usage
=====

```
zpub -- pipe lines from stdin to zmq pub socket

Usage: zpub [options]
  -p <port>        Server port (default: 8006)
  -i <interface>   Interface to bind (default: *)
  -m <count>       ZeroMQ high-water mark (default: 1000)
  -h               Show this message and exit
```

```
zsub -- pipe zmq sub socket to stdout

Usage: zsub [options] host:port
  -h               Show this message and exit
  -f <filter>      Subscribe to filter
  -s <identity>    Set socket identity
```
